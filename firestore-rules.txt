# Firestore Security Rules to Fix "Missing or insufficient permissions" Error

## Option 1: Public Access (Development Only)
Use these rules for development/testing. They allow anyone to read and write to your database:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

## Option 2: Time-limited Public Access
More secure than Option 1, allows public access for a limited time:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2025, 12, 31);
    }
  }
}
```

## Option 3: Implement Authentication (Recommended for Production)
If you want to add authentication later, use these rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Update Firestore Rules:

1. Go to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: "flashcards-174c8"
3. Go to Firestore Database in the left sidebar
4. Click on "Rules" tab
5. Replace the existing rules with one of the options above
6. Click "Publish"

## For Quick Testing:
Use Option 1 rules to immediately fix the permissions error. You can always update them later for production.

## Current Issue:
Your app is trying to save flashcards without authentication, but your Firestore rules likely require authentication. The rules above will resolve the permissions error.
